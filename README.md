# To Future Northville Aerospace Members

This project was created with React, a framework for frontend website development. If you are looking to edit the site, I would recommend having a basic understanding of HTML (for the website structure), CSS (for the website styling), and TypeScript (for functionality). This project is organized into components, where each component is usually its own page. Most of the useful code is inside of the `src` folder, although site information like the title and icon will be in the `public` folder. Inside of the `components` folder, you can find the code and styling for each page. Most of the code should be fairly intuitive to edit, so good luck.

## Running
To start the project on a local port, open a terminal in the main directory and run `npm start`. This will allow you to edit the website and view your changes in real time.

## Deploying
To deploy the website to GitHub pages, where our website is being hosted (at least in 2024), enter the command `npm run deploy` in the main directory.
